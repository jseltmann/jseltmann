Hey, I'm Johann Seltmann, student at University of Potsdam.

I just finished my master's thesis about the knowledge-differences between text corpora and vision-and-language corpora.

Things I'm interested in include:
- computational linguistics
- especially simple language
- reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms
- European 🇪🇺 and World 🇺🇳 federalism

I speak German, English, and some broken Italian. And that's really only a little bit, so if you do want to message me about something, don't use Italian.

Here are some of my projects, in various stages of well-documentedness:
- [DSGeneration](https://github.com/jseltmann/DSGeneration): A research project trying to find out, to what extend bigrams can be used for semantic information.
- [GeDisCo](https://github.com/jseltmann/GeDisCo): A project attempting to build a German Discourse Parsing corpus by parsing relations on an English text and transferring them to the German translation of the text.
- [vision-based-language](https://github.com/jseltmann/vision-based-language): My thesis project. Attempts to find if there are any differences in the knowledge contained in language datasets and vision-and-language datasets.
- [ReinforceSimpl](https://github.com/jseltmann/ReinforceSimpl): Pet project that I come back to every now and again. It attempts to fine-tune language models for language simplification using reinforcement learning.
- [EvolutionaryGaming](https://github.com/jseltmann/EvolutionaryGaming): Using an evolutionary algorithm to train a model to play Atari games.
- [familienmappe](https://github.com/jseltmann/familienmappe): Code I use to maintain a list of contact details for my wider family.
