Hey, I'm Johann Seltmann, working in NLP and Machine Learning more generally.
My professional focus so far has been on the development of a legal document search, the development of a cloud portal for customers and the evaluation and integration of AI technologies at iur.crowd.
I'm excited by language and computers and about being part of the developments in language AI. I want to make AI helpful for people and society e.g. in the public sector, in education, and in assistance for daily life.

In my free time, I'm active in the [Europa-Union Potsdam und Potsdam-Mittelmark](europa-union-ppm.de) towards a federal and democratic Europe and play the baritone in a church brass band.

Here are some of my projects, in various stages of well-documentedness:
- [DSGeneration](https://github.com/jseltmann/DSGeneration): A research project trying to find out, to what extend bigrams can be used for semantic information.
- [GeDisCo](https://github.com/jseltmann/GeDisCo): A project attempting to build a German Discourse Parsing corpus by parsing relations on an English text and transferring them to the German translation of the text.
- [vision-based-language](https://github.com/jseltmann/vision-based-language): My thesis project. Attempts to find if there are any differences in the knowledge contained in language datasets and vision-and-language datasets.
- [ReinforceSimpl](https://github.com/jseltmann/ReinforceSimpl): Pet project that I come back to every now and again. It attempts to fine-tune language models for language simplification using reinforcement learning.
- [EvolutionaryGaming](https://github.com/jseltmann/EvolutionaryGaming): Using an evolutionary algorithm to train a model to play Atari games.
- [familienmappe](https://github.com/jseltmann/familienmappe): Code I use to maintain a list of contact details for my wider family.
