Hey, I'm Johann Seltmann, student at University of Potsdam.

Currently working on my master's thesis about the knowledge-differences between text corpora and vision-and-language corpora.

Things I'm interested in include:
- computational linguistics
- especially simple language
- reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms
- European 🇪🇺 and World 🇺🇳 federalism

I speak German, English, and some broken Italian. And that's really only a little bit, so if you do want to message me about something, don't use Italian.

Upcoming: an overview of my various projects here and a bit more about that federalism thing.
